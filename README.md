# Seat-Selector-Simulation

This JavaScript program was created for the "Exploring Algorithms" project in AP Computer Science Principles.  
It simulates a seat selection process for a school sports game, letting the user either choose their seat or have one randomly assigned.

## Features

- Stores available seats in an array
- Allows the user to choose between:
  - Picking a seat manually (with input validation)
  - Letting the program randomly assign a seat
- Uses one function with a parameter to handle both options
- Removes the assigned seat from the array
- Calls the function twice with different arguments to simulate both paths

## Purpose

This project helped me practice:
- **Functions with parameters**
- **Conditionals**
- **Loops**
- **Random selection**
- **User input simulation**
